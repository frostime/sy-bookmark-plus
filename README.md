This plugin implements a more user-friendly bookmark feature, supporting drag-and-drop addition, bookmark group management, link copying, dynamic queries, and more.

> ðŸ”” Attention! By default, this plugin will hide the built-in bookmark button in the sidebar of SiYuan. You can disable this default behavior in the settings.

Below are the core functionalities. Please explore other detailed features on your own.

## Bookmark Groups

Click "Add" on the top bar to create a new bookmark group. Bookmark groups are classified into two types:

* Static Bookmark Group: A regular bookmark group where users can manually add or remove bookmark items

  * Supports custom drag-and-drop functionality
  * Supports moving items within the bookmark group to different groups
* Dynamic Bookmark Group: A query-based dynamic bookmark group that lists query results; supports the following rules:

  * SQL Query: Input SQL query statements
  * Backlinks: Input block ID to query the backlinks of the corresponding block
  * Block Attribute: Query specified block attributes. You can input the block attributes you want to query, such as:

    1. `<Attribute>`, e.g., `custom-b`, returns all blocks containing the `custom-b` custom attribute
    2. `<Attribute>=<val>`, e.g., `bookmark=test`, returns all blocks within the "test" bookmark
    3. `<Attribute> like <val>`

## Adding Items

### Static Group

In a static bookmark group, you can add bookmark items through the following methods:

1. Editor Block Drag-and-Drop: In the editor, directly drag the block icon into the bookmark group
2. Right-click Menu of the Bookmark Group:

    1. Add from Clipboard: You can copy a block's ID, reference, or link, and the plugin will automatically recognize and add it to the bookmark group
    2. Add Current Document Block: Adds the currently edited document to the bookmark group

### Dynamic Group

Dynamic bookmark groups mainly acquire bookmark items by executing queries.

1. Global Update: Click the update button on the top bar to update all bookmark groups
2. Right-click Menu: Click the right-click menu of the dynamic group to re-execute the query in the current group and obtain the latest bookmark items

  * Hide Closed Items: When enabled, hide items from closed notebooks
  * Hide Invalid Items: When enabled, hide deleted items
* Bookmark Groups

  * Displays all bookmark groups
  * Adjust the order of bookmark groups by dragging with the mouse
  * You can hide temporarily unnecessary bookmark groups by deselecting their display

## Styling

Each component within the plugin has a specific `class` name. If customization is needed (e.g., modifying fonts), you can write your own CSS styles and place them in SiYuan's "Code Snippets".

* Top-level: `.custom-bookmark-body`

  * Card mode: `.custom-bookmark-body.card-view`
  * Background color in card mode is based on two CSS variables:

    * Base background color: `--fmisc-bookmark-body-bg__card-view`, default is `var(--b3-theme-surface-light)`
    * Card background color: `--fmisc-bookmark-group-bg__card-view`, default is `var(--b3-theme-background)`
* Each bookmark group: `.custom-bookmark-group`

  * Bookmark group header: `.custom-bookmark-group-header`
  * Bookmark list: `.custom-bookmark-group-list`
* Each bookmark item: `.custom-bookmark-item`

Example:

* Modify the font of bookmark items

  ```css
  .custom-bookmark-item.b3-list-item {
    font-size: 20px;
    line-height: 24px;
  }
  ```
* Modify the card background color:

  ```css
  :root {
      --fmisc-bookmark-body-bg__card-view: white;
      --fmisc-bookmark-group-bg__card-view: grey;
  }
  ```

## Q&A

### Is there a way to import items from the built-in bookmarks of SiYuan?

* Create a new bookmark group
* Select Dynamic Group and Attribute Rule
* Fill in `bookmark` or `bookmark=<bookmark name>` in the attribute rule


### Can I modify the display title of bookmark items?

* Simply add block `name` attribute to blocks.
* When bookmark items are displayed, if a `name` is available, it will be displayed first. Otherwise, the `content` of the block will be displayed.


### What does the "Refresh" button in the top bar do?

* For dynamic groups, it re-executes the query and displays the most recent query results.
* For static groups, it checks the current status of each item (block) and updates them based on the latest results.
